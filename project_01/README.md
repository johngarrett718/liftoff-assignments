# Capstone Project Plan

## Overview
I am creating an application which can be used to add sales representatives, clients, and sales to a database. It can also display a list of all sales representatives and a list of all clients. When a sale is recorded, the application will calculate the proper amount of credit to each sales representative involved in the sale. There is credit for having the first contact, as well as for closing the sale. There will also be a table showing all credit earned by each sales rep for each day of a given month, as well as a monthly running total.
Users will find this useful for tracking their daily, weekly, and monthly sales numbers. It will allow them to see how they are pacing towards monthly sales goals, and how they are doing compared to other members of the sales organization.

## Features
User Login - Users will be able to create accounts abd log in to the application.

Create a new sales representative - Users will be able to create a new sales representative. Sales Representatives will appear in the list of Sales Reps and in the table of monthly sales.

Create a new client - Users will be able to create a new client. Clients will appear in the list of clients and in the table of monthly sales.

Create a sale - Users will be able to create a sale. Sales will appear in the table of monthly sales. 

Monthly Sales Table - A table row with all of the sales representatives, and coulumns of all of there daily sales. Each sale will have a hyperllink which shows the client name, city, and the names off all sales reps associated with the sale as well as their level of attribution. There wil be a total off all sales for each sales rep.

## What I'll Have to Learn

I will have to learn CSS to style my pages so they look professional and are easier to read / view. I am sure there are many other things that I will have to learn I don't even know what I don't know.
